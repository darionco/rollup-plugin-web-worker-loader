# rollup-web-worker-loader

Rollup plugin to handle Web Workers, Service Workers, Shared Workers,
Audio Worklets, and Paint Worklets. Support for Animation Worklets and
Layout Worklets is in consideration for when implementations are available
in browsers.

Web Workers are available in Node JS as well as in browsers. All the other
worklets and workers are available in browsers only, and will throw a runtime
error if used in Node JS.

Can inline the worker code or emit a script file using code-splitting.
Handles Worker dependencies and can emit source maps.
Worker dependencies are added to Rollup's watch list.
Supports bundling workers for Node.js environments

### Getting started

```
yarn add rollup-web-worker-loader --dev
```

Add the plugin to your rollup configuration:

```javascript
import webWorkerLoader from 'rollup-web-worker-loader';

export default {
    entry: 'src/index.js',
    plugins: [
        webWorkerLoader(/* configuration */),
    ],
    format: 'esm',
};
```

#### Web Worker Example

Bundle the worker code using the RegEx pattern specified in the plugin's configuration.
By default you can add the prefix `web-worker:` to your imports:

```javascript
// here we use the default pattern but any RegEx can be configured
import DataWorker from 'web-worker:./DataWorker';

const dataWorker = new DataWorker();
dataWorker.postMessage('Hello World!');
```

#### Shared Worker Example

```javascript
import SharedWorker from 'shared-worker:./SharedWorker';

const sharedWorker = new SharedWorker();
sharedWorker.port.postMessage('Hello World!');
```

#### Service Worker Example

```javascript
import ServiceWorker from 'service-worker:./ServiceWorker';

ServiceWorker.then(function(registration) {
    console.log('Registration successful, scope is: ', registration.scope);
})
.catch(function(error) {
    console.log('Service worker registration failed, error: ', error);
}
```

#### Audio Worklet Example

Audio Worklets require an audio context at instantiation. When you use
rollup-web-worker-loader in a browser environment, your import will
return a constructor to which you can pass an audio context.
##### Worklet Processor

```javascript
class MyAudioWorkletProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
}

registerProcessor("my-audio-worklet", MyAudioWorkletProcessor);
```

##### Worklet Consumer

```javascript
import registerMyAudioWorklet from 'audio-worklet:./MyAudioWorkletFactory';

const audioContext = new AudioContext();
registerMyAudioWorklet(audioContext);

class MyAudioWorklet extends AudioWorkletNode {
    constructor(audioContext) {
        super(audioContext, "my-audio-worklet"));
    }
}
```

#### Paint Worklet Example

##### Worklet Processor

```javascript
class MyPaintWorklet {
    ...
}

registerPaint('my-paint-worklet', MyPaintWorklet);
```

##### Worklet Consumer

```javascript
import registerMyPaintWorklet from 'paint-worklet:./MyPaintWorkletFactory';
registerMyPaintWorklet();
```

```css
html {
    background: paint(my-paint-worklet);
}
```

### Configuration
The plugin responds to the following configuration options:
```javascript
webWorkerLoader({
    targetPlatform?: string,        // The platform workers should be built for, can be 'auto', 'browser', 'node' or 'base64'.
                                    // specifying a target platform other than 'auto' reduces the amount of loader code.
                                    // The `base64` options forces inline and the import results on a base64 string that
                                    // encodes the worker's source code. NOTE: The string does not include a mime type.
                                    // 'auto' detectes the target platform and selects between 'browser` and 'node'.
                                    // Default: 'auto'

    web-worker?: RegEx,             // A RegEx instance describing the pattern that matches the files to import as
                                    // web workers. If capturing groups are present, the plugin uses the contents of the
                                    // last capturing group as the path to the worker script. Default: /web-worker:(.+)/

    shared-worker?: RegEx,          // A RegEx instance describing the pattern that matches the files to import as
                                    // shared workers. If capturing groups are present, the plugin uses the contents of the
                                    // last capturing group as the path to the worker script. Default: /shared-worker:(.+)/

    service-worker?: RegEx,         // A RegEx instance describing the pattern that matches the files to import as
                                    // service workers. If capturing groups are present, the plugin uses the contents of the
                                    // last capturing group as the path to the worker script. Default: /service-worker:(.+)/

    audio-worklet?: RegEx,          // A RegEx instance describing the pattern that matches the files to import as
                                    // audio worklets. If capturing groups are present, the plugin uses the contents of the
                                    // last capturing group as the path to the worker script. Default: /audio-worklet:(.+)/

    paint-worklet?: RegEx,          // A RegEx instance describing the pattern that matches the files to import as
                                    // paint worklets. If capturing groups are present, the plugin uses the contents of the
                                    // last capturing group as the path to the worker script. Default: /paint-worklet:(.+)/

    
    extensions?: string[],          // An array of strings to use as extensions when resolving worker files.
                                    // Default: ['.js']


    sourcemap?: boolean,            // When inlined, should a source map be included in the final output. Default: false

    inline?: boolean,               // Should the worker code be inlined (Base64). Default: true

    forceInline?: boolean,          // *EXPERIMENTAL* when inlined, forces the code to be included every time it is imported
                                    // useful when using code splitting: Default: false

    external?: string[],            // *EXPERIMENTAL* override rollup resolution of external module IDs
                                    // useful to inline external dependencies in a worker blob. Default: undefined

    preserveSource?: boolean,       // When inlined and this option is enabled, the full source code is included in the
                                    // built file, otherwise it's embedded as a base64 string. Default: false
    
    preserveFileNames?: boolean,    // When code splitting is used (`inline === false`) the input worker file names are
                                    // preserved, if duplicates are found `-n` is appended to the file names.
                                    // Default: false

    enableUnicodeSupport?: boolean, // When inlined in Base64 format, this option enables unicode support (UTF16). This
                                    // flag is disabled by default because supporting UTF16 doubles the size of the final
                                    // payload. Default: false

    outputFolder?: string,          // When code splitting is used (`inline: false`), folder in which the worker scripts
                                    // should be written to. Default: '' (same as build output folder)

    loadPath?: string,              // This option is useful when the worker scripts need to be loaded from another folder.
                                    // Default: ''

    skipPlugins?: Array             // Plugin names to skip for web worker build
                                    // Default: [ 'liveServer', 'serve', 'livereload' ]
})
```

### TypeScript
An example project that uses this plugin with TypeScript can be found [here](https://github.com/darionco/rollup-typescript-webworkers)

**WARNING:** `@rollup/plugin-typescript` is NOT compatible with this plugin, use `rollup-plugin-typescript2` instead (see [#38](https://github.com/darionco/rollup-web-worker-loader/issues/38)).

### Notes
**WARNING:** To use code-splitting for the worker scripts, Rollup v1.9.2 or higher is required. See https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/2801 for more details.

The `sourcemap` configuration option is ignored when `inline` is set to `false`, in that case the project's sourcemap configuration is inherited.

`loadPath` is meant to be used in situations where code-splitting is used (`inline = false`) and the entry script is hosted in a different folder than the worker code.

Setting `targetPlatform` to `'base64'` will ignore the `inline` option and will always inline the resulting code.


### Roadmap
- [x] Bundle file as web worker blob
- [x] Support for dependencies using `import`
- [x] Include source map
- [x] Configuration options to inline or code-split workers
- [ ] ~~Provide capability checks and fallbacks~~ DROPPED (all modern environments support workers) 
- [ ] ~~Avoid code duplication~~ DROPPED (there are better solutions for this purpose)
